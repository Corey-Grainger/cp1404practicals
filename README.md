### Clean Code Tips and Lessons from CP1404

- Following naming conventions closely makes it easier to write clean and readable code. Good names allow a more
  intuitive understanding of the code. For example when a plural is a list you don't have to put as much thought into
  identifying what the object is.
- Using the IDE's 'reformat code' shortcut on a regular basis reduces the number of error highlights and makes it easier
  to spot other problems in your code efficiently.
- If you take regular breaks you will often reset your train of thought and find errors or opportunities for improvement
  that you would otherwise have missed.
