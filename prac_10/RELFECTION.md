# Reflection

* The accuracy of my estimates was better when I had plenty of experience with a concept. I got a feel for how long it
  would take me to complete a particular task. For instance I felt my estimate for the taxi simulator was fairly
  accurate as it was mostly concepts I had plenty of practise with.
* Things I've learned from the code review process:
    * I'm still not pushing cmd + option + L enough.
    * I need to do docstrings when I first make (or extract) a function so I don't forget.
    * Explaining a concept for someone else helps you understand it better yourself. Specifically it improved my
      understanding of the 'properties' in kivy.
    * My classmates are nice.
* If I were in charge of the subject I might put a larger prac like the "project management" prac in week 4 or 5. This
  would give students a prac that uses all of the assignment concepts together to get some feedback on before doing
  assignment 1.  This is probably more helpful for people using these concepts for the first time.
